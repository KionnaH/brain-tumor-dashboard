\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Brain Tumor Data Visualization Dashboard\
\
This project was created as part of a capstone course at NYIT focused on building an interactive dashboard to visualize brain tumor data for medical professionals and researchers.\
\
#My Role\
\
I contributed to the front-end design and user interface of the dashboard, specifically:\
- Designed layout and structure using HTML and CSS\
- Applied styling for readability and accessibility using AI-assisted tools\
- Helped organize visual components to follow a logical medical data flow\
\
#Tools & Technologies\
\
- HTML  \
- CSS  \
- JavaScript  \
- Git & GitHub  \
- D3.js (used by the team)  \
- Chat GPT (for design support)\
\
# About the Project\
\
The dashboard visualizes data from over 2,000 patients and includes:\
- Tumor type distributions  \
- Treatment effectiveness  \
- Survival outcomes  \
- Dynamic filtering and hover interactivity\
\
The project was built as a collaboration with three other classmates.}

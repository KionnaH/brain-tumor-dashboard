# My Role

I contributed to the front-end design and user interface of the dashboard, specifically:
- Designed layout and structure using HTML and CSS
- Applied styling for readability and accessibility using AI-assisted tools
- Helped organize visual components to follow a logical medical data flow

# Tools & Technologies

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub

- AI Assistance 

# About the Project

The dashboard visualizes data from over 2,000 patients and includes:

- Dynamic filtering and hover interactivity

The project was built as a collaboration with three other classmates.
